                            <h4>1. Talent Scout</h4>
                            <p>We recruit relevant talent in today’s emerging and developed markets. We have two ways of approaching this premise: First, our Account Growth Managers onboard our Clients, understanding their needs so We are able to meet their expectations, then Our Talent Associates will source and pre-screen different profiles through the Premium version of LinkedIn Recruiter Lite as well as other relevant employment portals, afterward Our Account Growth Managers will send Our Clients the best-fitted Candidates for each position on demand. Our Talent Associates prepare Candidates for interviews, address concerns during the early stages of the process, and then Our Account Growth Managers support the communication in the negotiation stage (previously consented by the Client).</p>
                            <p>The second way We approach this premise is by using the candidate’s relevant information to nurture Our databases, in order to match eventual vacancies that may arise from Our client’s needs. We are constantly in search of both new clients and open positions, to assure on one side, a higher flow of job roles available, and on the other hand, to make sure a variety of existing candidates' profiles are saved to Our databases, which will then be accessible and available to match with Our Clients (with the candidate´s explicit consent).</p>
                            <p>Candidates will have constant communication from our Talent Associates, Candidates will have an Account Growth Manager as the point of contact between their needs and the Client’s needs, as well as a team to manage the entire recruitment cycle. If it’s the right candidate, Kubo Lab will work hand in hand with both parties to ensure a successful engagement between the parties, resulting in an effective hire that fulfills the needs and expectations of both Candidates and the Hiring Company (Client).</p>
                
                            <h4>2. Payroll Solutions</h4>
                            <p>We simplify contracts, paperwork, compliance, and cross-border payments for your team, all in one place. Once We find the talented Candidates, We take care of the whole hiring process, including payroll processing of the Candidates' monthly compensation, allowing Our Clients to focus on their core business.</p>
                            <p>Type of contract: Global Service Agreement through Kubo Lab LLC. Our company was incorporated in Florida, United States, for this reason, Our contracts are subject to the laws of the United States. We provide a service agreement between Kubo Lab and the contractor who will work as a third party for one of Our Clients.</p>
                            <p>Contract Requirements: It is important for the Independent Contractors to comply with all labor and tax obligations in each country of residence, depending on the case. We provide local benefits to candidates effectively recruited to work for Our Clients on a global scale. These benefits vary depending on overall compensation, jurisdiction, and mutual agreement, but We could include:</p>
                            <p><strong>Candidate Onboarding Process</strong>: <strong>Kubo Lab</strong> will make sure that the candidate understands the type of contract he/she is being hired for and its legal implications (both positive and negative), the benefits offered, and that he/she feels part of Our community, embraces Our values and company culture, receives all our news, and eventually has additional benefits in Our App’s marketplace.</p>
                            <p><strong>Compliance</strong>: Part of the Legal Consulting benefit, where we ensure that Candidates get all the precise information, guidance, and tools to fully comply with their local regulations, regardless of where the candidate or the client is located in the globe. If the Candidate is in good standing with his/her government’s obligations, We are in good standing with Our Legal Consulting benefit.</p>
                            <p><strong>Contracts</strong>: Taken care of by Us, so the Client does not incur all the time, costs, or hardships of getting the appropriate documentation signed by both parties.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cross-border payments</strong>: Will be made by <strong>Kubo Lab</strong> initially in USD or in the local currency of the Candidate, calculated by the official daily exchange rate of the day of the payment.</p>
                
                            <h4>3. Human Resources Products</h4>
                            <p>We provide people-centric products that guarantee employee retention, including:</p>
                            <p>Our Talent Associates at <strong>Kubo Lab</strong> act as an internal recruiter for the Client, ensuring efficiency and positive results to the recruiting process, relieving Our Client’s HR departments and hiring managers from administrative burdens while ensuring a world-class candidate experience. We quickly build pipelines of quality candidates in the location of the Client’s choice.</p>
                            <p>Data solutions for automated data, allowing Our Client’s decisions to be more informed, effective, and strategic regarding their own internal hiring processes.</p>
